# ðŸ“Œ Regression Model Performance Evaluation

## ðŸ“œ Overview
This project evaluates the performance of a regression model using the **RÂ² Score** (Coefficient of Determination). The RÂ² Score helps measure how well the model fits the data by quantifying the proportion of variance explained by the model.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
```
ðŸ“¦ Project Folder
 â”£ ðŸ“œ predictions.ipynb  # Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation
 â”£ ðŸ“œ README.md          # Project documentation
```

## ðŸš€ Usage
1. Open `predictions.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
2. Run the notebook to compute the **RÂ² Score** based on actual and predicted values.
3. Modify the dataset or model as needed to analyze different regression performances.

## ðŸ“Š RÂ² Score Formula
The RÂ² Score is calculated as:

\[
R^2 = 1 - \frac{SS_{res}}{SS_{tot}}
\]

where:
- **SS_res** = Sum of squared residuals (error between actual and predicted values)
- **SS_tot** = Total sum of squares (variance of actual values)
